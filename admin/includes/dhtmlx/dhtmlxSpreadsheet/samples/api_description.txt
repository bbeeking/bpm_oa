The easiest way to initialize spreadsheet is to use next contruction:

<script src="../codebase/spreadsheet.php?sheet=1" ></script>

it's html-object. All parameters can be specified in options.
../codebase/spreadsheet.php - path to file spreadsheet.php (it always in codebase directory)
parameters:
sheet - spreadsheet id (string or number)
parent - id of parent object (in which spreadsheet will be created). Fullscreen mode is used if it's not specified or null
key - key of spreadsheet. It can be useful to protect your data from edition.
load - url to loader (usually default connector codebase/php/data.php)
save - url to save (usually default connector codebase/php/data.php)


About key usage.
Key can be used to protect your spreadsheet from changes by unregistred users for example.
In database you specify some key for sheet.
If you are administrator and have access to sheet you can modify data.
But if you don't have key, you can only look at data, but can't use it,
cause readonly mode is turned on.


Classic initialization:
dhx_sh = new dhtmlxSpreadSheet({
	load: "../codebase/php/data.php",
	save: "../codebase/php/data.php",
	parent: "gridobj",
	icons_path: "../codebase/imgs/icons/"
});

All parameters are the same as in simple way initialization

To load existing sheet or create new one you should use:
dhx_sh.load(sheetid, key);

sheetid - id of sheet to load or create
key to access it (for existing sheet, optional)
